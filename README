# About

Siddur Olat Tamid represents the second edition of my personal siddur, originally crafted using XaLaTeX and now beautifully presented through Jupyter Book. I created this siddur out of necessity, as I was unable to find a published siddur following the German rite that met my needs. My goal was to design a siddur that was minimal, functional, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible for others.

Siddur Olat Tamid is an open source project. It is not only welcome, but encouraged to take part in the development of this work. This could mean creating [issues](https://github.com/wolf-math/olat_tamid/issues) if you feel there is a bug or a missing feature, or cloning the project and submitting pull requests. I'm more than happy to collaborate on this project to make it a community project.

This project has been a many years long journey. The development of the original XeLaTeX was tedious and prone to bugs. In this Jupyter Book version I've taken the DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) approach, especially with Tanakh, to minimize the possibility of bugs errors. Due to the semi-repeative nature of the tefilot, I was researching ways to move towards a framework that allowed a ReactJS-like component structure. The added benefit was being able to easily deploy my progress with GitHub pages as a book with minimal configuration.
