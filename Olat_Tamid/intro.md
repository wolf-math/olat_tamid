# סידור עולת תמיד


Siddur Olat Tamid represents the second edition of my personal siddur, originally crafted using XaLaTeX and now beautifully presented through Jupyter Book. I created this siddur out of necessity, as I was unable to find a published siddur following the German rite that met my needs. My goal was to design a siddur that was minimal, functional, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible for others.

The layout has been meticulously organized to ensure an attractive and clear presentation. This includes well-defined chapter and section headings and the strategic bolding of key phrases at the beginning of important paragraphs to guide the reader through the text seamlessly.

In keeping with a minimalist approach, you will find succinct instructions rather than extensive commentary or detailed guidance on performing specific prayers and rituals. This design choice helps preserve the clean flow of both the page and the text.

For those interested in deeper exploration of German Jewish traditions, excellent resources include Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz (http://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/), the K'hal Adas Yeshurun Jerusalem forums (http://www.kayj.net/en/forum/category/list), and the Nachalas Ashkenaz Facebook group.

I am profoundly grateful to Rallis Wiesenthal, whose outstanding work, Tefiloh Sefas Yisroel, inspired the first version of my siddur.
