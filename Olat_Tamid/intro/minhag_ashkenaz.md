Minhag Ashkenaz is the Jewish tradition of Northern Europe. The Jewish communities in Germany are thought to have been founded in the 5th century. The Golden Age of Ashkenazic Jewery was during the High Middle Ages just prior to the Crusades. The Jewish communities of Europe were devastated during the Crusades, with entire cities of Jews murdered. Blood libels and other false accusations forced many Jews to move east to Poland. Minhag Ashkenaz primarily refers to the unaltered Northern European/German tradition.\\

What differentiates Minhag Ashkenaz from the rest of European Jewry is primarily תפילה , tefilo (prayer). There are several differences here, but the most notable is the use of פיוטים , piyutim (poems) in certain sections. These Piyutim are said on special occasions such as holidays and days of special Torah readings. A great resource for Piyutim in Teflio is Machzor Shivchei Yeshurun by David J. Roth. Unfortunately my siddur does not contain many of these Piyutim, but indicates when some of them should be said.\\

Just a sample of the differences of Minhag outside of the Nusach HaTefilo are: unmarried boys wear a Talis, washing Al Netilas Yedayim before saying Kiddush, the use of a Winpel during a Bris. Most of these minhagim appear in the Sefer Maharil by Rabbi Yaakov Moelin (c. 1365 - 1427) of Mainz. The most influential Modern progenitor of Minhag Ashkenaz is Rabbi Binyomin Hamburger.
