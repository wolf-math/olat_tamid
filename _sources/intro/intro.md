# About

This second edition of Siddur Olat Tamid represents a years long journey of the creation of my own personal siddur, originally crafted using XaLaTeX and now beautifully presented through Jupyter Book. I created this siddur out of necessity, as I was unable to find a published siddur following the German rite that met my needs. My goal was to design a siddur that was minimal, functional, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible for others.

The layout has been meticulously organized to ensure an attractive and clear presentation. This includes well-defined chapter and section headings and the strategic bolding of key phrases at the beginning of important paragraphs to guide the reader through the text seamlessly.

In keeping with a minimalist approach, you will find succinct instructions rather than extensive commentary or detailed guidance on performing specific prayers and rituals. This design choice helps preserve the clean flow of both the page and the text.

I am profoundly grateful to Rallis Wiesenthal, whose outstanding work, Tefiloh Sefas Yisroel, inspired the first version of my siddur. His contributions can be explored further at [The Open Siddur Project](http://opensiddur.org/compilations/siddurim/siddur-bnei-ashkenaz-a-german-rite-siddur-prepared-by-r-rallis-wiesenthal/)

# מנהג אשכנז

Minhag Ashkenaz is the Jewish tradition of Northern Europe. The Jewish communities in Germany are thought to have been founded in the 5th century. The Golden Age of Ashkenazic Jewery was during the High Middle Ages just prior to the Crusades. The Jewish communities of Europe were devastated during the Crusades, with entire cities of Jews murdered. Blood libels and other false accusations forced many Jews to move east to Poland. Minhag Ashkenaz primarily refers to the unaltered Northern European/German tradition.

What differentiates Minhag Ashkenaz from the rest of European Jewry is primarily תפילה , tefilo (prayer). There are several differences here, but the most notable is the use of פיוטים , piyutim (poems) in certain sections. These Piyutim are said on special occasions such as holidays and days of special Torah readings. A great resource for Piyutim in Teflio is Machzor Shivchei Yeshurun by David J. Roth. Unfortunately my siddur does not contain many of these Piyutim, but indicates when some of them should be said.

Just a sample of the differences of Minhag outside of the Nusach HaTefilo are: unmarried boys wear a Talis, washing Al Netilas Yedayim before saying Kiddush, the use of a Winpel during a Bris. Most of these minhagim appear in the Sefer Maharil by Rabbi Yaakov Moelin (c. 1365 - 1427) of Mainz. The most influential Modern progenitor of Minhag Ashkenaz is Rabbi Binyomin Hamburger. 

For those interested in deeper exploration of German Jewish traditions, excellent resources include [Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz](http://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/), the [K'hal Adas Yeshurun Jerusalem forums](http://www.kayj.net/en/forum/category/list), and the Nachalas Ashkenaz Facebook group.

# Development

Siddur Olat Tamid is an open source project. It is not only welcome, but encouraged to take part in the development of this work. This could mean creating [issues](https://github.com/wolf-math/olat_tamid/issues) if you feel there is a bug or a missing feature, or cloning the project and submitting pull requests. I'm more than happy to collaborate on this project to make it a truly community project.

The development of the original XeLaTeX was tedious and prone to bugs. In this Jupyter Book version I've taken the DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) approach, especially with Tanakh, to minimize the possibility of bugs errors. Due to the semi-repeative nature of the tefilot, I was researching ways to move towards a framework that allowed a ReactJS-like component structure. The added benefit was being able to easily deploy my progress with GitHub pages as a book with minimal configuration.
