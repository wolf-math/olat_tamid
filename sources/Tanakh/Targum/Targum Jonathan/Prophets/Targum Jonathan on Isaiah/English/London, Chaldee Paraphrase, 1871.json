            "The Burden Of The Cup Of Cursing To Give Damascus To Drink. Behold, Damascus is removed, so as to be no more a kingdom: and it shall be as a city laid waste. ",
            "Their cities are deserted, they are laid waste; they shall be for dwelling-places for flocks of sheep; they shall lie down, and none shall make them to move away.",
            "The government shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of the solitary ones from Syria, and their glory shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the Lord of hosts.",
            "And it shall come to pass at that time, that the glory of Jacob shall be humbled, and the riches of his glory shall be carried away.",
            "And it shall be, as when one gathereth the standing harvest, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as one that is gathering ears in the valley of giants.",
            "Yet a gleaning shall be left in it, as in the shaking of the olive tree, two or three berries on the top of the uppermost branch; so shall the righteous be left lonely in the midst of the world, among the kingdoms, saith the Lord, the God of Israel.",
            "At that time a man shall stay himself upon the service of his Maker, and his eyes shall hopefully look for the WORD, the Holy One of Israel.",
            "He shall not rest upon the altars, the work of his hands, or stay himself upon that which his fingers have prepared, neither upon the groves nor upon the sun-images.",
            "At that time the cities of their strength shall be as a fortification that was laid desolate and waste from before the children of Israel, and each shall be a desolation.",
            "Because thou hast forsaken the God of thy salvation, and thou hast not remembered the fear of the Mighty One, whose Word was thy support; therefore thou hast planted a choice plant, and hast multiplied despicable works.",
            "After that ye were sanctified to be a people, there ye made your works despicable; and also when ye came to the land, the place of my Shekinah, there it was your duty' to worship me; ye forsook my worship, and ye served idols: ye abhorred repentance till the day of your destruction came, then your sorrow was a breathing out of soul.",
            "Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the sea, and to the tumultuous assembly of kings, which roar like the roaring of mighty waters.",
            "The kings roar like the roaring of many waters, and he shall rebuke him, and he shall flee far off, and shall be driven as the chaff of the hills before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.",
            "And at eveningtide behold, as if he had not been; and before the morning behold, as if he had not been. This is the portion of those that hate us, and the lot of those who spoil us."
