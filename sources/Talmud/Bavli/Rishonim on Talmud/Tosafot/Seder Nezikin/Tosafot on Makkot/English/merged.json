                "Some commentaries extrapolate from here a prohibition on the self-imposed Niduyim that people tend to take upon themselves nowadays, even if they are time-bound. ",
                "Refutation: This is not correct however. The condition that Yehudah made was not in his power to fulfill (seeing as there was nothing he could have done had Yosef held him back or had some other accident occurred on the journey). But Niduyim which people place on a person not to do this or that, which basically lie in his power to fulfil, the Niduy is ineffective to begin with (seeing as we know in advance that he has no intention of breaking the condition)."
