                "2. Takes <i>arakh</i> vows - if one says on another, 'the arakh of so-and-so is upon me'. He gives that arakh value of so-and-so according to his years that the arakh values were given according to years [age] as written in the Chapter of Arakhin. And after the years of the subject of the arakh vow we follow.",
                "3. Can be subject to <i>arakh</i> vows - if one says on, my arakh is upon me, or if another says upon him, 'so-and-so's arakh is upon me'.",
